The Stickempires (SE) API provides an interface to make Stickempires bots. Since SE doesn't
have an official API, this API relies on screen capturing Stickempires and abstracting away
those details of the game so bot makers can focus on higher-level details.

For developers, I have included:
    - An installation guide for getting the necessary libraries.
    - Documentation for what functionality currently exists in the API.
    - Tutorial covering some points I didn't cover elsewhere: https://youtu.be/URPfOzxQBEg.

Challenges solved:
    1. Clicking various buttons on the screen (i.e. "Play Match").
    2. Sending the appropriate input type to the game.
    3. Recognizing (correctly) how much gold and mana the bot has.
