Since an installer is not included, I will write out dependencies I needed (you may prefer
others depending on your computer specs):
    openCV/cv2 (image recognition)
    ffmpeg (playing videos)
    pyautogui (screen capture)
    pytest (optional, unit testing)

Installation guide:
    1. Download numpy, pyautogui ("pip install numpy", "pip install pyautogui")
    2. Download cv2.
        a) Go to https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#opencv
        b) Download the appropriate version for you.
        c) Install the whl file using pip.
    3. Download ffmpeg.
        a) Download the latest ffmpeg version here: https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/
        b) Extract the files and put it somewhere safe (Program Files, for example)
        c) Add the bin folder to the PATH variable

        alternatively, a python ffmpeg wrapper can be installed if you would like to keep it in
        a virtual environment. This article seemed good:
